('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

```+ + 'a'``` has no number between the 2 plus signs. This attempts to add nothing to 'a' and returns NaN or Not a Number. The browser then coerces NaN into a string resulting to baNaNa.
Finally, lowercase() method turns the capital N's from NaN to lowercase and returns 'banana'.
